Welcome in the repository of the machine learning model for the _bert-faqclass_ project! This repository contains the code to design a machine learning model for faq classification based on BERT, with special handling of keywords that may be out of vocabulary.

_Note_: check out the use case description in this [Medium article](https://nicola-massarenti.medium.com/end-to-end-machine-learning-bert-faqclass-81fd07d24058).

### Installing

It's easy! You just need to install the virtual environment.
